## Overview & Origin

 The Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) is an SEC-registered national securities exchange built for companies and investors in every industry who share a long-term vision. LTSE aims not only to influence change within publicly traded companies today, but to bring about a new generation of company leaders who make sustainable business practices a priority. More specifically, LTSE is a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), meaning it has the power to create and enforce industry and professional regulations and standards on its own. 

The Certificate of Incorporation for Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE) was originally filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on July 26, 2017 under the name of Long-Term Stock Exchange, Inc. [(1)](##-Appendix) The LTSE opened for public trading on September 9, 2020.

 LTSE is also a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company. They develop and licences software and services for building modern companies and pursuing a path to the public markets as well as maintaining a coalition of long term-focused companies and like-minded investors. The suite of software tools includes everything a founder might require as a startup looking to eventually take a business public.

### **VISION**

LTSE's vision is a public market that supports investment, experimentation, and scaling that companies can use to find continuous success; one that can open the way for innovation and value creation far into the future. [(2)](##-Appendix)

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*MPJD9WihZSvMBOdy7rHpYw.jpeg" alt="the-lean-startup" width="800">

### **COMPANY ORIGIN**

The concept came to Founder & CEO, Eric Reis, while in the process of writing his book, *The Lean Startup*. In fact, he proposed the idea for the LTSE in the epilogue of the book. Eric had found a recurrent theme in his conversations with company founders, executives, long-term insitutional investors, money managers, and others:

> "They described the immense pressure on companies to pursue short-term results over creating value for future decades and generations. They described innovation held hostage by boom-bust cycles, abrupt changes in governance, struggles to maintain constancy of purpose, and the difficulty for public companies in knowing who their long-term shareholders even are. One of the few things that pretty much everyone agreed on is that the focus on the short term undermines the building of sustainable businesses."[(3)](##-Appendix)

## Landscape

### **SECTOR**

LTSE is first and foremost a software company. While the company sought regulatory approval to launch its exchange, it developed and released a suite of tools that enable companies on the path to going public to make smarter business decisions and manage partnerships with investors. 

LTSE has two overarching software products on the market: LTSE Bridge and LTSE Horizon.

LTSE Bridge is a software platform used by more than 60,000 business builders to manage and forecast key startup resources including people, equity, and cash to build strong, sustainable startups. It includes tools for cap table management, 409A processing, cashflow management, and hiring plan tools. 

<img src="https://ltse.com/static/a7e6e66a70b57b2c619f0075801d4d70/bc8e0/scrnsht3.png" alt="the-lean-startup" height="150"> <img src="https://ltse.com/static/599fddbb0ab563dd18601107f4285ec0/bc8e0/options.png" alt="the-lean-startup" height="150"> <img src="https://ltse.com/static/98bd084f32fa311e43648b6101c82e31/bc8e0/scrnsht2.png" alt="the-lean-startup" height="150">

LTSE Horizon is a software platform for public companies that drives transparency on the IPO process and that optimizes the long-term orientation of your partners and investors.

> "Our mission is to enable the next generation of bold, visionary companies to thrive. Each tool is something we choose to invest in to create eco-system reform, a fundamental part of our mission." -Eric Ries, LTSE CEO[(5)](##-Appendix)

In addition, LTSE owns and operates an exchange that can be broadly charactarized as an ESG Exchange, meaning the organizations that list its shares for sale on the LTSE must follow a [published set of guidelines](https://longtermstockexchange.com/listings/principles/) for good practices in the areas of Environment, Social, and Governance. 

 It's in this respect that LTSE differs from other U.S. national securities exchanges. The exchange was built to support companies and investors who share a long-term vision. In order to list shares on the exchange, companies are required to codify, publish, and maintain a series of enforceable policies that are designed to provide shareholders and other stakeholders with insight into their long-term strategies, practices, plans and measures.[(6)](##-Appendix)

### **MAJOR TRENDS & INNOVATIONS**

LTSE sits at the crossraods of financial technology, software, long-term sustainability, and securities exchanges. As such, there are a multitiude of trends and innovations that have disrupted the space. Below are four main areas that are believed to have played a major role in disrupting the financial industries LTSE play a role in.

<img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fsap%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F04%2FProfitability-and-Sustainability-04-10-2017-A-1200x802.jpg" alt="sustainable-investments" width="800">

**Sustainability & ESGs**

> "“For the first time since WWII we sense a shift in which climate and the environment — not growth — will become the priority of governments and their citizens, as shortages of food, clean water and air become existential questions,” Saxo Bank Chief Economist Steen Jakobsen said in his latest quarterly outlook report.[(7)](##-Appendix)

Across all asset classes, including equities, government bonds, ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and hedge funds, investors around the globe are demanding better options for socially and environmentally consious invemstments. Increasingly, awareness on climate issues coupled with progressing policy change around the world and green tech becoming increasily less expensive, makes sustainably built companies more attractive. 

<details>
<summary>Click the arrow for more ESG & sustainability data on each asset class.</summary>

- **ETF's:** According to recent ETFGI data, ESG ETFs represented $52 billion of the $6 trillion global assets under management (AUM) of the ETF market.[(7)](##-Appendix)

- **Bonds:** A record setting $185 billion in green bonds in 2019 was raised in total to fund environmentally sustainable projects, according to data from law firm Linklaters.[(7)](##-Appendix)

- **Hedge Funds:** The AIMA and KPMG conducted a survey of 135 institutional investors, hedge fund managers and long-only managers with total AUM of $6.25 trillion across 13 countries, and found that 84% of managers reported an increased interest in ESG-orientated funds and strategies over the last 12 months.[(7)](##-Appendix)
</details>

In a letter to CEO's last month, BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, laid it out planinly, "Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects... awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.”[(8)](##-Appendix)

ESG's, meanwhile, have exploded in the financial industry, with flows more than doubling in 2020 from $20 Billion to $42 Billion. Additionally, ESG's represent more than 20% of new flows going into equity ETFs for 2020, sor far.[(9)](##-Appendix)

**Tech & Speed**

Chairman Jack Reed (D-R.I.) highlighted the “tremendous technological innovation,” and subsequent regulation, that is changing the landscape of U.S. equity markets. He said the adoption of Regulation ATS and Regulation NMS led to the proliferation of new trading platforms and has “put a premium on speed,” giving an advantage to firms that can place orders first and take advantage of minuscule price differentials between the trading venues. 

He also noted the explosive growth of high frequency trading in recent years, and the benefits that it has had on the market and investors. However, he said the increasing use of automation and advanced computing technology has raised questions about the effect that these processes have on the stability, fairness, and integrity of U.S. markets. [(10)](##-Appendix)

**Rise Of The Retail Investing**

It's been called the Robinhood effect. In an unprecedented shift that shows how far reaching the implications of a post-Covid world can be, millennials and Gen Z have started to abandon video games and sports betting in favor of a new craze: the stock market.

In the first quarter of 2020 alone, discount online brokerages in Canada added 500,000 new accounts, according to Investor Economics, growing at three times their normal pace. That same growth was seen in the U.S., where commission-free trading platform Robinhood added three million new clients in the same timeframe.[(11)](##-Appendix)

While insitutional investors are skeptical of this new crop of investors who are simply following the longstanding advice of "Don't fight the Fed" and always #BTFD ("Buy the f*cking dip,"), a top strategist at a major Wall Street bank that tracks market performance says the retail investor has so far outperformed the traditional instituions this year. 

"I’m just looking at the scoreboard on the year," he says. "And the work-from-home trader has been a pretty good performer."[(12)](##-Apendix)


**SaaS, PaaS, AI, & Big Data**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming more widespread and it's becoming a game-changing indsutry worth more than $15.7 trillion. [(!)](##-Appendix) AI optimizes business processes, increasing productivity and efficiency while automating repetitive tasks and supporting human capabilities. When SaaS is combined with AI capabilities, it enables businesses to obtain better value from their data, automate and personalize services, improve security, and supplement human capacity.

In addition, Vertical SaaS has become a growing specialization for companies. Whereas Horizontal SaaS focuses on clients across any sector and industry, Vertical SaaS is designed to be completely customizable, targeting clients within specific industries and supply chains. Vertical Saas provides wide-ranging benefits, including customer intelligence, pre-defined metrics and KPI's, improved data governance, and higher quality service.

Finally, 2020 could see the rise of Platform-as-a-Service - developments that empower businesses to build custom apps as add-ons to their original services. PaaS offerings are robust, flexible, and accessible, which means companies will be able to scale their business more easily by using a platform as a service.

### **COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

Competition is heating up for the U.S. Stock Exchanges as three newcomers are launching in September 2020 alone (including LTSE, MIAX Pearl Equities, and Members Exchange). This will bring the total to 16 stock exchanges vying for market share, with NYSE-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N operating five, Cboe Global Markets CBOE.Z running four, Nasdaq with three, and IEX Group one (LTSE trades under Cboe Global Markets).

This is all set against a backdrop of a rise in "retail" investors, choppy trading volumes, and recent highs from the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, buouyed by unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve. 

There are currently no exchanges that specifically targets long-term, sustainable companies and investors in the United States. On an international scope, the closest competitor is EuroNext, however, they do not serve the same geographic marketplace.

> Euronext supports companies from local and international blue chips to small and medium enterprises with listing services to meet their specific needs.  Issuers in all geographies and from all sectors can grow by raising capital on our regulated markets in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon, London and Paris, and benefit from exposure to the exchange’s diverse, international client base.[(**)](##-Appendix)

While the "legacy" exchanges - such as the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc., and the S&P 500 - may be considered competitors in the traditional sense, LTSE supports and encourages dual-listing, so that a company can still benefit from LTSE's protections while accessing liquidity at the open/close from a legacy exchange.[(?)](##-Appendix)

## Business Activities

### **CHALLENGE**

A 2013 survey of more than 1,000 board members and C-suite executives gauging their long-term approach in managing their companies found that 79% of respondants felt pressured to demonstrate strong financial performance over a period of just two years or less and 46% said that the pressure to deliver strong short-term financial performance stemmed from their boards, while the board members expressed that they were just channeling the short-term pressures that they feel from institutional investors.[(^)](##-Appendix)

Focused on quarterly earnings and growth, companies are pressured for results by stackeholders on a narrow timeline which can cause companies to undermine future economic growth with the lack of long-term investment, ultimately leading to a slowing GDP, higher unemployment levels, and lower future investment returns for savers. Managing a company for the sake of the short-term is counter-intuitive to a philosophy of long-term thinking that research shows contributes to the creation of value over time.

The challenge: How do we get net-new ESG qualifying companies into the publicly traded marketplace and influence the mindshare of the next generation of company managers to view long-term principles as a competitive advantage?

### **SOLUTION**

Long-Term Stock Exchange aims to solve the short-term mindset of value creation that dominates companies on the standard stock exchanges by focusing on long-term value growth steeped in 5 governing principles. 

LTSE accomplishes this through a broad suite of software and services for building modern companies and pursuing a path to the public markets, a U.S. national securities exchange, and a coalition of long term-focused companies and like-minded investors.

> "Our listing standards are designed to create a new public market experience that aligns modern companies and investors focused on creating value over generations." -Michelle Greene, President

Companies that list their shares for sale on the Long-Term Stock Exchange will be required to publish a series of policies that focus on long-term value creation and are designed to provide shareholders and other stakeholders with insight into the way that companies operate and build their businesses for the long-term.[(#)](##-Appendix) 

The 5 Principles of LTSE Companies:

1. Long-term focused companies should consider a broader group of stakeholders and the critical role they play in one another’s success.

2. Long-term focused companies should measure success in years and decades and prioritize long-term decision-making.

3. Long-term focused companies should align executive compensation and board compensation with long-term performance.

4. Boards of directors of long-term focused companies should be engaged in and have explicit oversight of long-term strategy.

5. Long-term focused companies should engage with their long-term shareholders.[(#)](##-Appendix)

Stock churn has been on the rise with annual turnover of stocks traded on the NYSE increasing from 36% in 1980 to 63% in 1996, and up to a high of 138% in 2008.[(^)](##-Appendix) On the LTSE, stockholders will be granted more voting power the longer they hold a stock, incentivizing investors to buy in early and keep skin in the game over the long-term. 

### **TARGET CUSTOMERS**

LTSE's primary customer are private companies seeking to go public that also contain within their core structure guidelines on sustainability, inclusion and diversity, employee treatment, and more.

Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

 According to SEC filings, LTSE's software business is currently serving approximately 20,000 users, mostly early stage companies.”[(&2)](##-Appendix)]

LTSE's secondary customers are long-term investors who are looking for a code of ethics that a company is obliged to follow. 

Not only does the data show that there is a tangible consumer demand for ESG stocks, research also shows that investors are willing to pay more for them.

A study published in January by Augustin Landier of HEC Paris Business School, Jean-François Bonnefon of Toulouse School of Economics, and Parinitha Sastry and David Thesmar of MIT Sloan, showed that investors are willing to pay $0.7 more for a share in a company giving one more dollar per share to charity. The study also revealed that firms exercising a negative social impact were valued at $0.9 less per share than those considered socially “neutral.”[(7)](##-Appendix)]

2020 Global ETF Investor Survey from U.S. private bank Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH) estimated that nearly 74% of global investors plan to increase their ESG ETF allocation over the next year. In five years, almost one in five investors said they would allocate between 21% and 50% of their portfolio to ESG funds, and BBH concluded that ESG “doesn’t appear to be a passing fad.”[(7)](##-Appendix)]

Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?


On a tertiary level, the exchange is open to any registered broker-dealer who is a member of at least one other national securities exchange and is able to clear trades.

In the long-term, LTSE seeks to "change-over" established organizations to LTSE, exclusively.

### **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE**

Today's companies deserve a public market where they are rewarded for making smart choices that embrace their futures - choices to innovate, to invest in their employees, and to seed future growth. It is imperative to not only create awareness but to act and implement these practices in a way that holds companies to a higher standard.

Research show that long-term mindset pays off. From 2001-2014, the revenue of long-term firms cumulatively grew on average 47 percent more than the revenue of other firms, and with less volatility. Cumulatively, the earnings of long-term firms also grew 36 percent more on average over this period than those of other firms, and their economic profit grew by 81 percent more on average.[($)](##-Appendix)

With software and services for building modern companies and pursuing a path to the public markets, a U.S. national securities exchange, and a coalition of long term-focused companies and like-minded investors, LTSE supports companies that are built to last and investors who measure their horizons in decades and value companies accordingly.[(2)](##-Appendix)

LTSE leverages these three arms of their business to give their stakeholders and companies an unparalled edge in creating long-term value and sustainable growth.


### **FUNDING**

The Long-Term Stock Exchange raised approximately $18.7 million in Series A funding back in July 2016, with Floodgate and the now-inactive Lowercase Capital participating in the round, according to Crunchbase data and SEC disclosures from the time. [(*)](##-Appendix)

More recently, two legal entities which comprise the LTSE filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that the LTSE has raised approximately $50 million in new funding. The first filing was from Delaware-based “LTSE Services, Inc.”, which disclosed $49,738,849 in new funding, sourced from 65 investors.[(&)](##-Appendix)] A secondary entity, “LTSE Group, Inc.” disclosed it sold $261,149 worth of equity, also to 65 investors.[(&2)](##-Appendix)]

Regarding LTSE Services, Inc., the SEC states that owners of LTSE Group “also will directly own a separate, affiliated Delaware-incorporated entity, LTSE Services, Inc. a software business currently serving approximately 20,000 users, mostly early stage companies.”[(&2)](##-Appendix)]

While LTSE doesn't release public information about it's earnings as a private entity, marketing intelligence firm ZoomInfo shows that revenue has decreased significantly during the Covid-19 era, down to $2.2 Million in Q2/3 2020 from approximately $6.6 Million at the same time in 2019.[(;)](##-Appendix)
